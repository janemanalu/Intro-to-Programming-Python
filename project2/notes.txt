1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
    As the name suggest, this project has the purpose to help students understand the functions of control flow better.
    Using if, while, for-in range commands, I get to familiarize myself to python3 commands and this will be a big help for next projects
    as a future reference.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
