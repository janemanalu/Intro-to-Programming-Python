Problem 1. 
(Day of the Week) Write a program called day_of_week.py that accepts m (int), d (int), and y (int) as command- line arguments, representing a date, and writes 
the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, and so on) dow to standard output, computed as

y0 = y−(14−m)/12,
x0 = y0 + y0/4 − y0/100 + y0/400, 
m0 = m+12×((14−m)/12)−2,
dow = (d+x0 +31×m0/12)mod7.

Directions:
- Accept three integers m, d, and y as command-line arguments.  
- Compute and write the value of day of the week dow.
- Use // (floored division) for / and % for mod.

Problem 2. 
(Mercator Projection) The Mercator projection is a conformal (angle preserving) projection that maps latitude φ and longitude λ, expressed in degrees, to rectangular 
coordinates (x, y). It is widely used — for example, in nautical charts and in the maps that you print from the web. The projection, with the center of map set to 
the prime meridian (0 degrees) and radius of Earth set to 1, is defined by the equations
                                                                   x = λ and y = ln(1+sin φ / 1-sin φ) / 2

Write a program called mercator.py that accepts latitude φ (float) and longitude λ (float) as command-line arguments and writes the corresponding x and y values to 
standard output, separated by a space.

Directions:
- Accept two floats φ and λ as command-line arguments.
- Compute and write the values of x and y, separated by a space.  Use math.radians() to convert degrees to radians.
- Use math.log() for natural logarithm.
